<h1>Study</h1>

<p>Authors:<br> </p>
<p>Aim:<br> This study investigates whether changing the colour temperature of indoor lighting can help improve the health of healthy adultsâ€™ emotions in life.</p>
<p>Sample:<br> N/A </p>
<p>Procedure:<br> This study (N=16) investigated the effect of correlated colour temperature (CCT: 2500k, 5000k, 8500k, 18000k, 500lx) on individuals exposed to specific light sources for one hour in the morning. The scores are based on two levels psychological experience and physical performance. PANAS was used to perform mood scores as a psychological level of monitoring. </p>
<p>Results:<br> The study found that except for the positive change of emotional PA-P under the condition of 8500k light in the morning, the results of other light parameters showed no noticeable activation effect. It can be seen from the score of PANAS-P that with the increase in colour temperature, PANAS-P has a positive effect. However, it will not improve because of the continuous increase in colour temperature. It will reach a relative peak at around 8500k, but because there is no more detailed classification of lighting parameters, it is impossible to get a precise change interval.</p>
<p>Conclution:<br> A strong correlation was also found between tympanic temperature and KSS score under the four different light parameters, confirming that core body temperature and sleepiness level interacted with each other. Therefore, it is questionable whether universal lighting solutions are suitable for the use of lower CCT in daily life. </p>
