<p>Aim:<br>We propose a machine learning approach to quantify the consistency and specificity of colour–emotion associations and the degree to which they are country-specific<br> </p>
<p>Sample:<br>195 German (22 male, 172 female, age range: 16-75, mean 33.3), 126 UK (39 male, 87 female, age range: 17-71, mean 40.6) ,252 Greece (male 31, female 220, age range: 15-76, mean 30.4), 138 China (male 37, female 101, age range: 17-79, mean 36.1)<br> </p>
<p>Procedure:<br>On the first page of the survey, we provided information about ethical issues relevant to the participation in the study. Participants expressed their consent to participate by clicking on the ‘Let's go’ button. The following two instruction pages explained the task and the use of the GEW. We then tested their task comprehension using a fictitious rating they had to correct according to the instruction: ‘Peter thinks that beige strongly represents intense compassion, and believes that beige is also associated with mild relief. Accidentally, he has selected sadness and wants to correct his choice. Look at his response in the emotion wheel below and try to correct it’. Participants could only move to the next page and start the survey if they clicked on the square for sadness (no association), the largest circle for compassion (emotion intensity 5) and the middle circle for relief (emotion intensity 3). This allowed us to be sure they understood both how to use the GEW and the task. <br> Next, the actual task started. Participants saw 12 colour terms in their native language (table 2), appearing above the GEW one at a time in randomized order. They were asked to rate the intensity of the association between each of the 20 emotion terms contained in the GEW and the given colour term on the 6-point rating scale explained above. The participants were only allowed to proceed to the next colour term if they had assigned at least one rating, i.e. (1) associated at least one emotion with the given colour term (i.e. had clicked on at least one of the circles on the GEW), (2) had clicked on the ‘No emotion’ response button, or (3) had specified an association with an emotion not contained in the GEW (i.e. clicked on the ‘Different emotion’ button). <br> After evaluating the 12 colour terms, participants completed a demographic questionnaire on which they reported their age, gender, potential colour vision impairments, importance of colour in their life, country of origin, country of residence, native language and fluency in the language the colour–emotion survey was completed in. Participants could decline to answer the demographic questions. On the final page, participants were thanked and received results from a previous, related study in a graphic format. We provided an e-mail address in case participants had questions or comments regarding the study, or wished to be informed about this or other research studies. The entire survey took on average 13 min to complete.<br> </p>
<p>Results:<br>"Similarly, only Greek participants associated PURPLE with sadness while participants from other countries evaluated PURPLE as emotionally ambivalent (China and Germany) or positive (the UK). PURPLE is a liturgical colour symbolizing suffering, pain and mourning, and it is used for decorations during Advent and Lent in orthodox churches. The association between sadness and PURPLE might be more dominant in Greece than other studied countries, when considering that Greeks sometimes wear darker shades of purple during mourning periods."<br> </p>

A machine learning approach to quantify the specificity of colour–emotion associations and their cultural differences

We propose a machine learning approach to quantify (a) the consistency and specificity of colour–emotion associations and (b) the degree to which they are country-specific

195 German (22 male, 172 female, age range: 16-75, mean 33.3), 126 UK (39 male, 87 female, age range: 17-71, mean 40.6) ,252 Greece (male 31, female 220, age range: 15-76, mean 30.4), 138 China (male 37, female 101, age range: 17-79, mean 36.1)
